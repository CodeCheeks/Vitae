That said, the vast majority of users who come to our center adapt perfectly within one to three weeks. This depends to a great extent on the collaboration of the family members.

What is very important is to visit a Day Center beforehand so that the professional team of the Center can advise you once you have told them about your needs and the situation of your elderly person.
